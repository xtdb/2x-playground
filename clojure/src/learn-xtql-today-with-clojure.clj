;; # Learn XTQL Today, with Clojure

;; Welcome! This is a [Clerk](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk) "notebook" written for [Clojure](https://clojure.org) users as a showcase of XTDB's developer-friendly, data-oriented query language: XTQL.

;; XTDB is a bitemporal database with a SQL API that automatically stores the `system_time` and `valid_time` histories of all data without any configuration or explicit schema design. This notebook does not explore XTDB's SQL or time-travel capabilities, although the [`:xt$system-time`](https://docs.xtdb.com/intro/data-model.html#_temporal_columns) and [`:xt$valid-time`](https://docs.xtdb.com/intro/data-model.html#_temporal_columns) columns may be easily examined.

;; XTQL is designed to be language agnostic and supports a first-class JSON representation for use with a wide variety of language SDKs (coming soon!). However, for this tutorial we are focused on the Clojure SDK experience.

;; Learn XTQL Today is derived from the classic [learndatalogtoday.org](http://learndatalogtoday.org) tutorial. This interactive tutorial designed to teach you XTQL. XTQL is a declarative database query language with roots in logic programming and SQL. XTQL has equivalent expressive power to SQL and relies on the SQL standard library to ensure full interoperability between the two languages. Feel free to try constructing and running equivalent SQL queries as you learn XTQL!

;; The JSON version of XTQL is essentially a more verbose translation of the [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn)-based representation seen below.

;; Please read the instructions carefully before evaluating anything, and in particular, *do not* immediately eval this entire namespace ðŸ™‚

;; ## Powered by Clerk âš¡

;; [Clerk](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk) is a live-programming Clojure notebook experience that makes building interactive tutorials like this one _easy_, and running through them _fun_!

;; If you are viewing a static HTML version of this notebook then feel free to skip the next couple of sections as all the examples should be fully rendered & ready for passive consumption! Otherwise, let's continue...

;; ## Booting up & REPL usage

;; Before we start, let's assume you have no other XTDB-related REPL open or Docker image running. Equally let's assume that you have no other local software running on port `3000` that might conflict.

;; 1. Start a REPL using the instructions in `clojure/readme.md` and connect to it from your editor

;; 2. Evaluate the ns definition in isolation first - do not eval the whole namespace!

;; 3. Once that ns eval has returned successfully, eval the initializing `do` block inside the first `comment` below (this will take some time) and then open your browser at [`https://localhost:7777`](http://localhost:7777)

^{::clerk/visibility {:code :hide :result :hide}}
(do
  (comment ;; initializing `do` block (this will take some time)
    (do
      (clerk/clear-cache!)

      (clerk/serve! {:watch-paths ["src"]
                     :browse? false}) ;; http://localhost:7777
      (clerk/show! "src/learn-xtql-today-with-clojure.clj"))

    )

  (declare my-node) ;; by default, an ephemeral XTDB node will be started up by Clerk automatically when the `serve!` command runs (after also clearing the Clerk cache)

  (comment ;; a handy reset `do` block in case the state gets confusing
    (do
      (when (not= (type my-node) clojure.lang.Var$Unbound)
        (.close my-node))
      (clerk/halt!)
      (clerk/clear-cache!)
      (clerk/serve! {:watch-paths ["src"]
                     :browse? false}) ;; http://localhost:7777 - remember to refresh the webpage!
      (clerk/show! "src/learn-xtql-today-with-clojure.clj"))
    ))

;; If all is well (we'll confirm that soon enough) then Clerk will have already evaluated the rest of the namespace on your behalf, which includes starting up an ephemeral XTDB server container (as we'll see below shortly). This means you don't need to eval any of the side-effecting forms hereafter and can focus on understanding the read-only query interactions.

;; ## Start an in-process, ephemeral XTDB server

;; We will run XTDB as an in-process server which is useful for writing tests and rapid experimentation. However, XTDB is primarily intended to be run in production as an out-of-process server (like a regular database server/cluster) and therefore use of remote APIs is strongly recommended for the best experience.

;; For the purposes of this tutorial though we are starting up an ephemeral (i.e. data is not persisted across restarts) XTDB 'node', and by the time you are reading this your node should have already started.

;; First we must use `start-node` - no configuration is supplied so all data is in-memory and will be lost when the node is closed or the environment is shutdown.

^{::clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
(def my-node (xt.node/start-node {}))

;; The XTDB instance referred to by `my-node` should by now have started running successfully, which we can confirm by calling the `status` API and seeing `{:latest-completed-tx nil :latest-submitted-tx nil}` in response.

(xt/status my-node)

;; Next we need some data. XTDB interprets maps as both "documents" and "jagged rows" interchangeably. These maps can be handled without a predefined schema - they only need a valid ID primary key. In the data below (which is defined using edn, and is fully explained in the next section) we are using integers as IDs. We are also using nested vector values, meaning the schema is not properly normalized (in the regular SQL sense of "3NF") - but no problem - XTQL can handle this!

;; Note that using explicit "join tables" (like in SQL), instead of such nested structures, can still be very useful and will typically result in better out-of-the-box performance.

;; The following two vectors contain two kinds of documents respectively: documents relating to people (actors and directors) and documents relating to movies. As a convention to aid human interpretation, all persons have IDs like `1XX` and all movies have IDs like `2XX`. Many ID value types are supported, such as strings and UUIDs, which may be more appropriate in a real application.

;; NOTE: XTDB also has a JSON-over-HTTP API that naturally supports JSON documents using JSON-LD for an extended range of types.

;; The following code maps over both sets of docs to generate a single transaction containing one `put` operation per document, whilst also specifying the relevant table, and then submits the transaction.

(xt/submit-tx my-node (concat
                       (for [doc my-persons]
                         (xt/put :persons doc))
                       (for [doc my-movies]
                         (xt/put :movies doc))))

;; NOTE: loading the small amount of data we defined above can be comfortably done in a single transaction. In practice you will often find throughput benefits to batching `put` operations into groups of 1000 at a time.

;; With XTDB running and the data loaded, you can now execute a query, which is a Clojure list, by passing it to XTDB's `q` API. The meaning of this query will become apparent very soon!

(xt/q my-node '(from :movies [movie/title]))

;; To simplify this `xt/q` call throughout the rest of the tutorial we can define a new `q` function that saves us a few characters and visual clutter.

^{::clerk/visibility {:code :show :result :hide}}
(def q (partial xt/q my-node))

;; Queries can then be executed trivially:

(q '(from :movies [movie/title]))

;; You can also use this same `q` API to run SQL queries by passing it a raw string instead of an XTQL data structure.

(q "SELECT movies.movie$title FROM movies")

;; NOTE: Clojure keywords are only used superficially for representing columns (/ document keys) in the Clojure SDK, and internally only the SQL string representation is store. This enables a keyword like `:a.b.c/d` to be natively accessible via SQL as `a$b$c$d` (also meaning `:a.b/c.d` can't be losslessly round-tripped).

;; ## Extensible Data Notation

;; An XTQL query is written in [extensible data notation (edn)](http://edn-format.org). Edn is a data format similar to JSON, but it:

;; * has more base types,
;; * is extensible with user defined value types,
;; * is a subset of [Clojure](http://clojure.org) data.

;; Edn consists of:

;; * Numbers: `42`, `3.14159`
;; * Strings: `"This is a string"`
;; * Keywords: `:kw`, `:namespaced/keyword`, `:foo.bar/baz`
;; * Symbols: `max`, `+`, `title`, `?title`
;; * Vectors: `[1 2 3]` `[foo "bar" ?baz 123 ...]`
;; * Lists: `(3.14 :foo [:bar :baz])`, `(+ 1 2 3 4)`

;; * ...and a few other things which we will not need in this tutorial.

;; ## Basic Queries

;; Once again let's look at our first example query which finds all movie titles in our example database and this time discuss how it works:

(q '(from :movies [movie/title]))

;; XTQL queries consist of composable operators, optionally combined with a pipeline, but this instance we only have [`from`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_from) which is a "source" operator that retrieves a relation from a table stored in XTDB.

;; The first argument it takes is the keyword name of the table to fetch data from, here it is the `:movies` table. The operator then takes a vector specifying which columns to return, in this case just listing the plain symbol `movie/title` which corresponds to the `:movie/title` key within a our document.

;; NOTE: Within the Clojure SDK, columns (document keys) are inserted as keywords (e.g. `:movie/title`) but throughout queries are only accessed/represented via bindings using their corresponding symbols (e.g. `movie/title`). Columns and "logic variables" (which are introduced later in the Unification section) use symbols interchangeably to represent columns.

;; The example database we're using contains *movies* that mostly, but not exclusively, from the 1980s. You'll find information about movie titles, release year, directors, cast members, etc. As the tutorial advances we'll learn more about the contents of the database and how it's organized.

;; This schema overview should serve as a helpful reference:

#_:clj-kondo/ignore
^{::clerk/visibility {:result :hide}}
(comment
  +-------------------------+  +---------------------+
  |         Movie           |  |       Person        |
  | * :xt/id          INT   |  | * :xt/id        INT |
  | * :movie/title    STR   |  | * :person/name  STR |
  | * :movie/director INT   |  | * :person/born  INT |
  | * :movie/cast     INT[] |  | O :person/death INT |
  | O :movie/sequel   INT   |  +---------------------+
  +-------------------------+                         )

;; If we wish to find the IDs (as in the `:xt/id` primary key) of all people named (via the `:person/name` key) "Ridley Scott" we are able to specify a mapping to a string value within the `from` operator's column definition. This mapping acts as a filter. In this case there is only one match:

(q '(from :persons [{:person/name "Ridley Scott"} xt/id]))

;; Alternatively, we can construct a "pipeline" of operators to perform the same task more explicitly and use an explicit [`where`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_where) operator to filter the source relation. The `=` equality expression is used within the `where` operator.

(q '(-> (from :persons [person/name xt/id])
        (where (= person/name "Ridley Scott"))))

;; Since XTQL is subjected to query planning and optimization, these two queries result in equivalent execution plans.

;; If we want to avoid unnecessarily processing and returning the `person/name` column in the output relation (returned under the `:person/name` key in each result map), we can use a final [`return`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_return) operator to restrict the output to a specific set of of columns.

(q '(-> (from :persons [person/name xt/id])
        (where (= person/name "Ridley Scott"))
        (return xt/id)))

;; ### Exercises

;; Q1. Find the IDs and titles of movies in the database

(q '(from :solve-me [xt/id]))

;; Q2. Find the name of all people in the database

(q '(from :solve-me [xt/id]))

;; Q3. Find the IDs of movies made in 1987

(q '(from :solve-me [xt/id]))


;; ### Solutions

;; A1.

(q '(-> (from :movies [xt/id movie/title])))

;; A2.

(q '(-> (from :persons [person/name])))

;; A3.

(q '(-> (from :movies [xt/id movie/year])
        (where (= movie/year 1987))
        (return xt/id)))

;; ## Relational Composition

;; XTQL provides the [`rel`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_rel) source operator which can be used to construct and manipulate a temporary, in-memory relation. This relation can be use within a pipeline in the exact same way as a stored relation represented using `from`. Similarly, columns can be returned explicitly:

(q '(rel [{:foo "bar" :baz "qux"}] [foo]))

;; ...and we can use a `*` binding to retrieve a nested representation of all columns from the relation:

(q '(rel [{:foo "bar" :baz "qux"}] [*]))

;; NOTE: the use of `*` is rarely appropriate for production queries, but certainly useful while exploring data

;; Let's run a previous query over a subset of the original data (which is _not_ re-submitted to the database):

(q '(-> (rel [{:xt/id 137 :person/name "Ridley Scott"}
              {:xt/id 118 :person/name "Ronny Cox"}]
             [xt/id person/name])
        (where (= person/name "Ridley Scott"))
        (return xt/id)))

;; This query avoids retrieving any of the stored data altogether and is completely disconnected from the `:persons` table (i.e. the correspondence of `:xt/id` with the stored data is inconsequential).

;; ### Unnest

;; Nested values can be access as regular columns using the [`unnest`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unnest) operator which returns a cross-joined relation.

(q '(-> (rel [{:foo "bar" :my-list [1 2 3]}] [foo my-list])
        (unnest {:my-item my-list})))

;; Using the [`with`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_with) operator, which extends the previous relation with additional columns, specific nested values can be accessed using `.` and `nth` operators.

(q '(-> (rel [{:foo "bar" :my-list [{:bar "baz"}]}] [foo my-list])
        (with {:my-item (nth my-list 0)})
        (with {:my-val (. my-item bar)})))

;; ## Unification

;; Joins in XTQL are most naturally specified using the [`unify`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unify) operator - this combines multiple input relations based on the use of logic variables to represent and connect various columns. Within a `unify` scope all symbols represent logic variables rather than singular columns. However a logic variable may take the name of real column which creates an implicit binding.

;; `unify` provides a declarative and terse method of specifying join conditions (i.e. how relations should be combined with each other). The elements within a unify scope are called "clauses". The user-provided clause order is inconsequential and therefore it is best to arrange clauses for ease of readability and human comprehension.

;; Let's say we want to find out who starred in "Lethal Weapon". We will need to process two source relations for this, both `:movies` and `:persons`, and to achieve this we can embed two `from` operators within a `unify` (which itself simply returns a relation). However this requires introducing our first user-named logic variable (here we have chosen `p`) and we also need to [`unnest`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unnest) the stored vector of IDs retrieved as `movie/cast`:

(q '(-> (unify (from :movies [{:movie/title "Lethal Weapon"} movie/cast])
               (unnest {p movie/cast})
               (from :persons [{:xt/id p} person/name]))
        (return person/name)))

;; Logic variables can be re-used and referenced as much as required, across many clauses, within a single unify scope. Think of unification as similar to simultaneous equations in mathematics - a logic variable that connects multiple underlying columns forces the database to "solve" the query using whatever joins are necessary.

;; NOTE: An implicit binding will re-use the underlying column name (e.g. `movie/cast` in `from` above) for the logic variable, but you can always use an explicit binding map instead (e.g. `{:movie/cast c}`) if you struggle with the verbosity of the logic variables caused by long underlying column names.

;; ### Exercises

;; Q1. Find movie titles made in 1985

(q '(from :solve-me [xt/id]))

;; Q2. What year was "Alien" released?

(q '(from :solve-me [xt/id]))

;; Q3. Who directed RoboCop? You will need to use `[<movie-eid> :movie/director <person-eid>]` to find the director for a movie.

(q '(from :solve-me [xt/id]))

;; Q4. Find directors who have directed Arnold Schwarzenegger in a movie.

(q '(from :solve-me [xt/id]))

;; ### Solutions

;; A1.

(q '(-> (from :movies [movie/title {:movie/year 1985}])
        (return movie/title)))

;; A2.

(q '(-> (from :movies [{:movie/title "Alien"} movie/year])
        (return movie/year)))

;; A3.

(q '(-> (unify (from :movies [{:movie/title "RoboCop"} movie/director])
               (from :persons [{:xt/id movie/director} person/name]))
        (return person/name)))

;; A4.

(q '(-> (unify (from :persons [{:xt/id arnie} {:person/name "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}])
               (from :movies [movie/cast movie/director])
               (unnest {arnie movie/cast})
               (from :persons [{:xt/id movie/director} person/name]))
        (return person/name)))

;; ## Parameterized queries

;; Looking at this query:

(q '(-> (unify (from :persons [{:xt/id sylvester} {:person/name "Sylvester Stallone"}])
               (from :movies [movie/cast movie/title])
               (unnest {sylvester movie/cast}))
        (return movie/title)))

;; It would be great if we could reuse this query to find movie titles for any actor and not just for "Sylvester Stallone". This is possible using parameters, which are supplied as a map under an `:args` key to options map of `xt/q`. Within queries, parameters can be referenced using the `$` prefix to a symbol.

(q '(-> (unify (from :persons [{:xt/id p} {:person/name $name}])
               (from :movies [movie/cast movie/title])
               (unnest {p movie/cast}))
        (return movie/title))
   {:args {:name "Sylvester Stallone"}})

;; You can pass any number of input parameters to a query, and these parameters be used for relations as well as the full range of value types.

;; For example, let's say you have the vector `["James Cameron" "Arnold Schwarzenegger"]` and you want to use this as an input parameter to find all movies where these two people collaborated. First, outside of XTQL, you would need to reshape the vector into a valid relation (i.e. a vector of maps with named columns) and refer to it via the [`rel`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_rel) source operator:

(q '(-> (unify (rel $director-actor-rel [director actor])
               (from :persons [{:xt/id d} {:person/name director}])
               (from :persons [{:xt/id a} {:person/name actor}])
               (from :movies [{:movie/director d} movie/cast movie/title])
               (unnest {a movie/cast}))
        (return movie/title))
   {:args {:director-actor-rel [{:director "James Cameron"
                                 :actor "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}]}})

;; Say you want to find all movies directed by either James Cameron **or** Ridley Scott, you can simply add an additional row to the input relation:

(q '(-> (unify (rel $directors [director])
               (from :persons [{:xt/id p} {:person/name director}])
               (from :movies [{:movie/director p} movie/title]))
        (return movie/title))
   {:args {:directors [{:director "James Cameron"}
                       {:director "Ridley Scott"}]}})

;; Now let's consider an input relation with columns `movie-title` and `box-office-earnings`:

'[
  ...
  {:movie-title "Die Hard" :box-office-earnings 140700000}
  {:movie-title "Alien" :box-office-earnings 104931801}
  {:movie-title "Lethal Weapon" :box-office-earnings 120207127}
  {:movie-title "Commando" :box-office-earnings 57491000}
  ...
]

;; Let's combine this data with the data in our database to find box office earnings for a particular director:

(q '(-> (unify (rel $earnings-data [movie-title box-office-earnings])
               (from :persons [{:xt/id p} {:person/name $director}])
               (from :movies [{:movie/director p} {:movie/title movie-title}])
               )
        (return movie-title box-office-earnings))
   {:args {:director "Ridley Scott"
           :earnings-data [{:movie-title "Die Hard" :box-office-earnings 140700000}
                           {:movie-title "Alien" :box-office-earnings 104931801}
                           {:movie-title "Lethal Weapon" :box-office-earnings 120207127}
                           {:movie-title "Commando" :box-office-earnings 57491000}]}})

;; ## Expressions

;; So far, we have only been dealing with joining of data across relations and unnested columns using basic equality. We have not yet seen how to handle questions like "*Find all movies released before 1984*". This is where **expressions** come into play.

;; Let's start with the query for the question above:

(q '(-> (from :movies [movie/title movie/year])
        (where (< movie/year 1984))))

;; Like all other functions and expressions in XTQL, this use of `<` reflects the standard SQL definition and behaviours (in SQL `<` is often referred to as a comparison operator"). This is particularly important to keep in mind when creating such expressions that work across multiple types (e.g. comparing different numeric values).

;; You can use [any supported SQL function](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/stdlib.html) from the XTDB standard library:

(q '(-> (from :persons [person/name])
        (where (like person/name "M%"))))

;; NOTE: if there are functions you need that we have not implemented yet, please ask or feel free to open an issue. XTDB does not currently support any extension point for user-defined functions (UDFs).

                              {:title "RoboCop", :rating 7.5}]}})

;; ## Generating columns

;; In addition to defining constraints, expressions can be used to transform data and return it via adding columns using the [`with`](https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_with) operator - either new columns for the next operator in a pipeline, or as additional columns within the `unify` scope.

;; For example, given a person's birthday, it's easy to calculate the (very approximate) age of a person:

(q '(-> (from :persons [{:person/name $name} person/born])
        (with {:age (- (extract "YEAR" (current-date)) (extract "YEAR" person/born))}))
   {:args {:name "Tina Turner"}})

;; ## Thank You

;; Thank you Jonas and contributors for freely licensing your excellent materials!

;; ## Static Build

;; If you're in an active REPL, run the following

(comment (clerk/build! {:paths ["src/learn-xtql-today-with-clojure.clj"]}))

;; Or otherwise:

;; 1. Clear the cache (clerk/clear-cache!) (or `rm .clerk/cache/*` / delete the `.clerk` directory)

;; 2. `clj -J--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED -X:nextjournal/clerk` (and be sure to not save this namespace in parallel / trigger cache changes)

;; 3. Browse the HTML file(s) created under `public/build/`
